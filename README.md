# Neural-Network-Architectures-for-FashionMNIST-Classification

This repository contains code and documentation for solving image classification tasks using various neural network architectures.

## Project Overview

In this project, our objective is to train different neural network architectures (FCNs, DNNs, CNNs) for image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset. We are tasked with:

- Determining the architecture of our models.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Comparing the performance of different models against each other.
