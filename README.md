# Neural-Network-Architectures-for-FashionMNIST-Classification

In this project, our objective is to train different neural network architectures (FCNs, DNNs, CNNs) for image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset. We are tasked with:

Determining the architecture of our models.
Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Comparing the performance of different models against each other.

## Overview

In this project, we address the problem of landing a rocket with three degrees of freedom (3DOF) and fixed final time by employing Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) and comparing the results and performance with those obtained from a general nonlinear solver available in free and open-source Python libraries
