# Neural-Network-Architectures-for-FashionMNIST-Classification

This repository contains code and documentation for solving image classification tasks using various neural network architectures.

## Project Overview

In this project, our objective is to train different neural network architectures (FCNs, DNNs, CNNs) for image classification using the FashionMNIST dataset. We are tasked with:

- Determining the architecture of our models.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Comparing the performance of different models against each other.

## Results

 Plots of loss over epochs and accuracy through epochs for training, validation, and testing were generated. From these values, the optimal network for classifying the FashionMNIST dataset was chosen across various architectures, optimizers, initialization techniques, regularizations, and normalizations.
